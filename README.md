# Document Analysis using LLMs with Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze documents using Large Language Models (LLMs) in Python. It covers text extraction from PDFs, summarization, question generation, and answering using state-of-the-art NLP models.

## Features
- Extract text from PDF files
- Summarize documents using a pre-trained model
- Split text into sentences and passages for better analysis
- Generate questions based on document content
- Answer generated questions using a question-answering model

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pdfplumber transformers nltk torch
```
